0.5.3 (2020-09-15)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release primarily restores legacy industry properties and vars which were removed in NML 0.5.0.  This is done for compatibility, so that older industry grfs can still be compiled with NML 0.5.3.

See the NML 0.5.0 changelog entry for a list of the legacy industry properties and vars that were removed, and are restored in NML 0.5.3. A warning will be shown when these are used, and they may be removed again in some future version.

- Change: Show more info in `nmlc --version
- Change: Reintroduce industry property 0.4 syntax for compatibility
- Fix: Rounding errors for some speed values (#147)


0.5.2 (2020-05-17)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release primarily fixes a spritelayout-related bug introduced in 0.5.1 that may affect many grfs.

- Fix #140: non-advanced sprite layouts don't have flags
- Fix: Make --cache-dir work
- Fix #139: Don't create the cache directory if --no-cache is passed


0.5.1 (2020-05-10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a number of issues reported in 0.5.0.

Note:
Although nmlc now permits up to 63 each of road and tramtypes, OpenTTD currently requires that the combined total not be more than 63 and that the same label not be used for both a roadtype and a tramtype.
These limitations are not checked by nmlc.

- Add: Builtin functions roadtype() and tramtype()
- Fix: Allow calculations for palette in spritelayout
- Fix #116: TownNames used bits could be the same for sub-parts (#117)
- Fix #120: Value range of transported_last_month_pct should be 0..100 (#122)
- Fix #121: STORE_PERM address limit should be 255, not 15
- Fix #134: Incorrect value of PALETTE_CC_RED
- Fix #74: Update ottd_display_speed to match changes from OpenTTD r23945 (#75)
- Fix: ANIM warnings in examples
- Fix: Make the industry example GRF do something, rather than crashing
- Fix: Correct limit of available road/tramtypes
- Fix: Produce, TownNames & TracktypeTable debug_print (#126, #127, #129)
- Fix: Don't attempt to determine version from git when building from a release tarball


0.5.0 (2020-04-26)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NML 0.5.0 is a substantial release, covering multiple areas of the newgrf spec.  Thanks to everyone who helped.


Industries
----------
NOTE TO AUTHORS: NML 0.5.0 removes many industry properties and vars.
Industry sets using these properties or vars will *not* compile with nml 0.5.0 and need to be updated.
All industry vars removed in 0.5.0 are replaced by equivalent new vars.
Production callback (produce block) format also changed so produce blocks will need to be updated.
We don't break NML backwards compatibility lightly, but this change was necessary to support 16 accepted and 16 produced cargos.
Thanks.
