/*
 * This file is aimed to provide an example on how to code a vehicle in NML
 * In this case a road vehicle is coded, other vehicle types work in a similar fashion.
 * To keep the code readable, not every property or variable is documented in
 * detail, refer to the vehicle-specific reference in the documentation.
 * The coded vehicle is relatively simple. Apart from the minimum required,
 * it has cargo-specific capacaity and graphics. For a more advanced example,
 * refer to the train example.
 *
 * The vehicle coded here is a first-generation flatbed truck.
 * It is taken from OpenGFX+ Road Vehicles, with some modifications
 * to provide a better example. Original graphics are by DanMack and Zephyris,
 * coding by Terkhen and planetmaker.
 *
 * Apart from this file, you will also need the following
 * - Graphics, found in 'gfx' folder.
 * - Language files, to be placed in the 'lang' folder.
 *      Currently only english.lng is supplied.
