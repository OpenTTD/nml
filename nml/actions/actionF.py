# - safe numbered:   Number is allocated by the user, and is safe to refer to.

# - invisible:       Number is allocated by a final town_name, without attaching a name to it. It is not accessible any more.
# Instances of the TownNames class have a 'name' attribute, which can be 'None' (for an invisible number),
# a string (for a named number), or a (constant numeric) expression (for a safe/unsafe number).
